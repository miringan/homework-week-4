This repository contains files that set up a Seattle Sports Trivia Quiz website, it contains an HTML file, a CSS file, and a java script file. When the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button, a series of trivia questions will display on the screen and the user will have the option to select one of the answers displayed in the form of buttons. All this occurs while a timer runs down from 60 seconds. The game is over when either all the questions have been answered or the timer runs down to zero. At the end of the quiz, the user will see their score and will be prompted to enter their initials to record their score. Once their score is submitted, a list of High Scores will appear. At that point, the user will have the option to take the quiz again or clear all high scores. Also, at any given time, the user may view the high scores via the button in the top left hand corner of the screen.
